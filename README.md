ClearMed is a **Healthcare Intelligence Platform** designed to help patients make **data-driven medical decisions** by providing hospital comparisons, treatment cost transparency, and treatment outcome insights.

The platform aggregates **anonymized hospital bill data**, hospital information, and patient feedback to generate **transparent healthcare insights**.

---

# 🚨 Problem

Healthcare decision-making is extremely difficult for patients.

Major challenges include:

- ❌ Patients don't know **which hospital is best for a treatment**
- ❌ Medical costs vary significantly between hospitals
- ❌ Healthcare pricing lacks transparency
- ❌ Existing platforms focus on **reviews instead of outcomes**
- ❌ Patients often know **symptoms but not diseases**

These issues lead to **unexpected medical expenses and poor treatment decisions**.

---

# 💡 Solution

ClearMed provides a **healthcare intelligence platform** that allows users to:

✔ Search hospitals by **symptoms, disease, or treatment**  
✔ Compare hospitals using **real treatment cost data**  
✔ View **doctor expertise and hospital metrics**  
✔ Upload **hospital bills for cost transparency**

The platform transforms fragmented healthcare data into **actionable insights for patients**.
